## DevNet Sandbox
This lesson leverages the [Always On: NETCONF/YANG & RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) Sandbox.  This sandbox requires no reservation **or** VPN connection.  

***Note: In the video, a different DevNet Sandbox is used*** 

When running the `curl` for the RESTCONF example, leverage `https://ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com:9443` as the URL instead of `https://10.10.20.21`.
